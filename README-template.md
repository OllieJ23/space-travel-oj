## Overview

This is a responsive web application, designed for desktop, tablet and mobile. It is meant as a mockup of a 'Space Travel' Website, utilising various libraries to aid in the process. This was done using React JS in collaboration with Figma.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - For Navigation
- [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/animation/) - For Animation
- [TS Particles](https://particles.js.org/) - Particle Animations
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Design / Brainstorming

### What I learned

I learned how to optimise my workflow, when dealing with several screen-sizes and keeping responsiveness in mind. Using Figma, i was able to greatly organise my components and re-use them, making the entire flow much smoother. I learned how to intergrate seamless animations using react-router and a third party library (TS Partcles), which gave the app a more dynamic feel.

### Continued development

Potential scope for further development could be a psuedo booking system for space travel, selecting dates, crew and destinations. The scope of the project was didnt include this originally, but i thought it would be a cool idea.
